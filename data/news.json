            "summary": "India's economy shows robust growth driven by strong manufacturing and services sectors, exceeding analyst predictions.",
            "content": "India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an impressive 7.8% in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing economists' expectations of 7.2%. The growth was primarily driven by a resurgence in the manufacturing sector, which expanded by 9.2%, and the services sector, which grew by 8.1%.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance attributed this strong performance to increased consumer spending, government infrastructure investments, and a boost in exports. The manufacturing sector benefited from the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, which have attracted significant domestic and foreign investments.\n\nExperts believe that if this momentum continues, India could achieve an annual growth rate of 7.5% for the fiscal year, making it one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. However, challenges such as inflation and global economic uncertainties remain concerns for policymakers.",
